**Imago Games OÜ Privacy Policy**

**Last Updated: 04.08.2023**

**1. Introduction**

Welcome to the Privacy Policy of Imago Games OÜ ("Imago Games," "we," "us," or "our"). We respect the privacy of our users and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. This Privacy Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you use our mobile game and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing that information.


**2. Detailed Data Collection**

**2.1 Anonymous Accounts and Player Identification:**
Upon accessing our game, anonymous accounts are automatically generated for players. Each player is assigned a unique PlayerId, which is utilized to map their in-game states and progress. Players have the option to set a username for their profile after account creation.

**2.2 IP Address Cache:**
For the duration of a game session, we might cache IP addresses. This is primarily to implement rate limiting, ensuring a consistent and fair gaming experience for all players.

**2.3 In-app Purchases:**
While players make in-app purchases through third-party providers such as Google and Apple, we do not directly process or store payment details. We receive and validate receipts from these providers to confirm purchases within the game.

**2.4 Third-party Analytics:**
We employ third-party analytics tools, specifically Unity Analytics, to improve and analyze the game's functionality. Unity Analytics may capture information about your device's operating system and unique device identifier.

**2.5 Gameplay Data:**
To enhance the player experience, we store data related to game progress, including levels achieved, achievements unlocked, scores, and other in-game statistics. This data allows players to track their performance and continue their gameplay seamlessly across sessions.

**2.6 Multiplayer Match History:**
For those engaging in multiplayer modes, match histories and interactions are recorded and stored on AWS services to provide a record of gameplay and to facilitate features like leaderboards or matchmaking.


**3. Purpose for Data Collection**

**3.1 Anonymous Accounts and Player Identification:** 
Our primary goal in auto-generating anonymous accounts and assigning a PlayerId is to offer continuity in gameplay and store individual player progress. This approach ensures that you can pick up from where you left off, regardless of any interruptions.

**3.2 Player Usernames:** 
Player-chosen usernames or nicknames are utilized for in-game identification, particularly during multiplayer interactions. These usernames are also displayed on leaderboards, allowing players to achieve recognition and interact competitively with others.

**3.3 IP Address Cache:** 
We cache IP addresses exclusively for rate limiting. This practice ensures that our game servers remain responsive and can accommodate a large number of simultaneous players without performance issues.

**3.4 In-app Purchases:** 
The information we receive concerning in-app purchases is strictly used to validate receipts from third-party providers like Google and Apple. As of now, this data doesn't serve any other purpose within our game.

**3.5 Third-party Analytics:** 
We employ Unity Analytics to continuously refine our game, understand player preferences better, and troubleshoot potential issues. The insights gained help us to optimize gameplay and deliver a more satisfying experience for all our users.

**3.6 Gameplay Data:** 
The primary purpose of collecting gameplay data is to allow players to view their statistics, achievements, and progression. Currently, we do not use this data for personalized in-game suggestions or recommendations.

**3.7 Multiplayer Match History:** 
Besides providing players with a record of their multiplayer matches and facilitating in-game functionalities like leaderboards or matchmaking, this data also aids our team in troubleshooting any issues or discrepancies that might arise during multiplayer interactions.


**4. Data Sharing and Third-party Access**

**4.1 Service Providers:** 
We collaborate with several third-party service providers that may have access to certain user data. These providers include:

**4.5 Protection and Safety:** 
User data may be shared or disclosed to address fraud, security risks, or technical issues, particularly if mandated by data protection regulations such as GDPR or CCPA.

**4.6 Aggregated or Anonymized Data:** 
We may share aggregated or anonymized data, which cannot identify individual users, for purposes like research, analysis, or improving our game. Such data sharing typically occurs when utilizing analytic SDKs like Google Firebase and Unity Analytics.

**4.7 User Consent:** 
Certain third-party SDKs might check for user consent configured in device settings and track data accordingly. Users always have the right to modify these settings to limit or permit data sharing based on their preferences.


**5. Data Storage and Security**

User data is primarily stored in data centers located in Europe and both North and South Americas. These locations are chosen based on infrastructure robustness and compliance with international data protection regulations.

Note that if you ask us to remove your personal data, we will retain your data as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**5.3 Security Measures:** 
The safety of our users' data is of utmost importance to us. We employ a range of security protocols, including:
- **Encryption:** User data is encrypted both during transit and at rest.
- **Access Controls:** Strict controls are in place to ensure only authorized personnel have access to stored data.
- **Security Audits:** We conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

**5.4 Data Breaches:** 
In the unfortunate event of a data breach, we are committed to informing affected users as swiftly as possible. Users will receive a detailed description of the breach, potential implications, and the measures taken to rectify the situation.

**5.5 Third-party Service Providers:** 
We rigorously vet our third-party service providers, ensuring they maintain a high standard of data security. Agreements with these providers include strict data protection clauses, and we routinely review their security practices.
